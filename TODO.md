====

* :small_red_triangle_down: Do noising in SQL script?
* :small_red_triangle_down: Enforce minimum number of nodes
* :small_red_triangle_down: Enforce exclusive partial task executor
* :small_red_triangle_down: Remove `query` feature
* Refactor to single task (i.e. not collecting unique times first)
* Documentation update
* :small_red_triangle_down: Nodes: add hash to your algorithm policies
* Allow for restricting which (algorihm) functions are allowed on a node
* How do we deal with filtering by a column (COHORT_ID)
* :small_red_triangle_down: Log in nodes printing too much (disclosing parameters/data sent by researcher)
* vantage6: wrong error message
  * Created issue: https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/issues/1105
* Multi party computation + homomorphic encryption
* Noise:
  * What's a good statistical test to feel comfortable noise is not compromising results?
  * To consider: noise based on variance?

 * Consider re-adding the binning and filter properties

:small_red_triangle_down:: Higher priority
