    Central part of the Federated Kaplan-Meier curve computation.

    This part is responsible for the orchestration and aggregation of the federated
    computation. The algorithm is executed in two steps on the nodes. The first step
    collects all unique event times from the nodes. The second step calculates the
    Kaplan-Meier curve and local event tables.

    Parameters
    ----------
    client : Vantage6 client object
        The client object used for communication with the server.
    time_column_name : str
        Name of the column containing the survival times.
    censor_column_name : str
        Name of the column containing the censoring.
    organizations_to_include : list of int, optional
        List of organization IDs to include (default: None, includes all).

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        Dictionary containing Kaplan-Meier curve and local event tables.
